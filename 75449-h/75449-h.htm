<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a wide contrast between the Hebrides
of Scotland and the New Hebrides of the Western
Pacific; but both have come into a good deal
of prominence of late—the one in connection
with the crofters, the other in connection with
the French. It is of the New Hebrides we
propose to say something.</p>

<p>The group of islands forming part of Melanesia
to which the name of New Hebrides has been
given extends for about seven hundred miles. The
most northern of the group is about one hundred
miles from the Santa Cruz Islands, and the most
southern about two hundred miles from New
Caledonia. Espiritu Santo is the largest and most
northerly of the group, and is about seventy-five
miles long by forty miles broad. The next largest
island is called Mallicolo, and is fifty-six miles
long by twenty miles broad. The entire land
area of the group may be taken as about five
thousand square miles; and the population of the
whole group has been estimated variously from
fifty thousand to two hundred thousand. But
whatever the total population, the peoples probably
sprung from one original stock, although
they have drifted far apart in the matter of
language. There are said to be no fewer than
thirty different languages in the New Hebridean
group—all having a certain grammatical likeness,
but quite unintelligible to the other islanders.
The difference is not merely such as exists
between Scotch, Irish, and Welsh Gaelic; it is
a more marked division of tongues.</p>

<p>The inhabitants vary nearly as much as their
languages. Although distinctly Papuan, there
are traits and traces of Polynesian intermixture
and even of separate Polynesian settlement.
Thus, on Vaté, the men are taller, fairer, and
better-looking than those on some of the other
islands, the more generally prevailing type being
one of extreme ugliness and short stature. They
all are, or have been, cannibals; but on Aneityum
they are now supposed to be all Christianised.</p>

<p>Aneityum, or Anateum, or Anatom—for it is
spelt in all three ways—is within two hundred
miles of the nearest point in New Caledonia,
and within five hundred miles of Fiji. It has
a spacious, well-sheltered harbour, which is easy
of access, and is throughout well wooded and
watered. The general character of the island is
mountainous; and there is an agreeable diversity
of hill and valley, the mountains being intersected
by deep ravines, and cultivated spots
alternating with barren tracts. The principal
wealth of this island is in its timber, of which
the kauri pine appears to be the chief; but there
is also a good deal of valuable sandal-wood.
Some years ago, an attempt was made to establish
a whale-fishery off the shores of Aneityum;
but we have not heard with what result. The
length of this island is about fourteen miles,
and its breadth about eight. The climate,
although damp, is not disagreeable, and is not
marked by great variations. The thermometer
seldom goes below sixty-two degrees, and never
below fifty-eight degrees; but, on the other
hand, it never goes above ninety-four degrees,
and seldom above eighty-nine degrees in the
shade.</p>

<p>Aneityum deserves especial mention because the
whole population is understood now to profess
Christianity. That population in 1865 was stated
by Mr Brenchley to be two thousand two hundred,
and it has not probably increased much,
if any, since then. Previous to 1850, the natives
of Aneityum were as degraded and savage as on
any island of the Pacific; but two missionaries
who settled there about the date mentioned began
to work a steady and continuous change.</p>

<p>The Aneityum people do not live in villages,
but separately in the midst of their cultivated
patches, which are divided into districts, each
containing about sixty. The government is in
the hands of chiefs, of whom there are three
principal, each having a number of petty chiefs
under them. But their power appears limited.</p>

<p>Aneityum, like the other islands of the New
Hebrides, is of volcanic origin, and it is surrounded
by coral reefs. No minerals have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_706">{706}</span>found; and in this connection it is worthy of
remark that Australians insist that there is
a much closer natural affinity between the New
Hebrides and Fiji than there is between the
New Hebrides and New Caledonia, which is an
island rich in minerals. Mr Brenchley enumerates
the principal indigenous products of Aneityum
as bread-fruit, banana, cocoa-nut, horse-chestnut,
sago-palm, another species of palm bearing small
nuts, sugar-cane, taro—the staple article of food—yams
in small quantities, sweet-potatoes, and
arrowroot. Of fruits, &amp;c., introduced, the orange,
lime, lemon, citron, pine-apple, custard-apple,
papaw-apple, melons, and pumpkins, have succeeded.
The cotton plant had also been introduced,
and promised well; and French beans
were grown for the Sydney market. There
are more than a hundred species of ferns on the
island, and more than a hundred species of
fish in the waters surrounding it. But the fish
are not all edible, and besides being different
from, are inferior to those found in the northern
hemisphere. The birds are not very numerous;
but butterflies and insects abound, in the
case of the latter the list being lengthened
by the importation of fleas by Europeans.
Among themselves, the natives barter fishing-baskets,
nets, sleeping-mats, hand-baskets, pigs,
fowls, taro, and cocoa-nuts. With foreigners,
they barter pigs, fowls, taro, bananas, cocoa-nuts,
sugar-cane, &amp;c., for European clothing, hatchets,
knives, fish-hooks, and so forth. Their weapons
are spears, clubs, bows and arrows—the spears
being rude and very crooked.</p>

<p>Of Tanna, another of the southern division
of the group, many interesting notes have been
left by Mr Brenchley and Dr Turner. It is
about forty or fifty miles from Aneityum, and
has a somewhat narrow anchorage, called Port
Resolution Bay. On the west side of this bay
there is a large and preternaturally active volcano,
which pulsates in a regular sequence of eruptions
at intervals of five, seven, or ten minutes, night
and day, all the year round. The regularity of
the eruptions is supposed to be caused by the
influx of water into the volcano from a lake
which lies at its base. Tanna is nearly circular,
and between thirty-five and forty miles across.
It is covered with lofty hills, bright with
verdure.</p>

<p>Mr Brenchley stated the population at fifteen
to twenty thousand; but Dr Turner placed it
at only ten or twelve thousand; and Turner,
who resided for some months on the island, is
likely to be nearer the mark. The people are
of middle stature, and of a copper colour naturally,
although some of them are as black as
New Hollanders, through artificial dyeing of
their skins. They are rather better-looking than
average Papuans, but make themselves hideous
with red paint. The men frizzle their hair,
which is oftener light-brown than black in
colour; the women wear the hair short, but
‘laid out in a forest of little erect curls about
an inch and a half long.’ They pierce the septum
of the nose, and insert horizontally a small piece
of wood; and in their ears they wear huge
ornaments of tortoise-shell. They do not tattoo.
The women wear long girdles, hanging to the
knee, made of the dried fibre of banana stalks;
and the men wear an unsightly waistcloth of
matting. Their weapons are clubs, bows and
arrows, and spears, with which they are very
expert, and they always work and sleep with
their weapons by their sides. They are, in fact—or
were, when Dr Turner lived among them—a
race of warriors, for the tribes were incessantly
at war with each other. ‘We were never able,’
says Dr Turner, ‘to extend our journeys above
four miles from our dwelling at Port Resolution.
At such distances we came to boundaries which
were never passed, and beyond which the people
spoke a different dialect. At one of these
boundaries, actual war would be going on; at
another, kidnapping and cooking each other; and
at another, all might be peace, but, by mutual
consent, they had no dealings with each other....
When visiting the volcano one day, the natives
told us about a battle in which one party which
was pursued ran right into the crater, and there
fought for a while on the downward slope inside
the cup!’</p>

<p>The climate of Tanna is damp for four months
of the year, when fever and ague are common;
but it is agreeable during the remainder of
the year; and the average annual temperature
is about eighty-six degrees. The soil, on account
of the volcanic origin, is extremely fertile, and
there are a number of boiling springs.</p>

<p>Erromango, to the north of Tanna, is celebrated
for its massacres of missionaries and white settlers,
and it was here that Mr Williams was murdered
many years ago. This island is covered with
dense vegetation down to the very water’s edge.
It contains a great deal of fine timber, such
as sandal-wood, kauri pine, &amp;c. The population
was estimated at about five thousand by both
Mr Brenchley and Dr Turner. The people are
very much like the Tannese, but are without
any settled villages or considerable chiefs. The
Erromangan women tattoo the upper part of
their bodies, and wear leaf-girdles hanging from
waist to heel; but the men prefer nudity.
Neither infanticide nor euthanasia seems to prevail
here, but the sick are not particularly well
cared for. Dr Turner traced a belief in witchcraft
and some belief in a future state. The
spirits of the dead are supposed to go eastward,
and some are thought to roam about in the
bush.</p>

<p>Vaté or Sandwich Island, still to the north,
is another interesting member of the group. It
has attracted many Australians and others, who
have attempted settlements, but not, we believe,
with success as yet. Dr Turner calls it a ‘lovely
island’—although, whether it compares with the
island of Aurora, one of the most northerly of
the group, which Mr Walter Coote says is a
perfect earthly paradise, we cannot tell. Vaté,
at anyrate, is very lovely, and seems to be of
coral formation. Its size is about one hundred
miles in circumference, and its population perhaps,
ten thousand—although Dr Turner said twelve
thousand. There is no general king, but a large
number of petty chiefs. The people are more
fully clothed than those of the other islands we
have referred to; they do not tattoo—they only
paint the face in war; they wear trinkets and
armlets; and they live in regular villages. There
are several dialects, but not such diversity as in
Tanna. They do not fight so much as the
Tannese; but have clubs, spears, and poisoned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_707">{707}</span>arrows. Infanticide, unfortunately, is prevalent,
and seems to be the consequence of the practice
of the women having to do all the plantation
and other hard work.</p>

<p>In Vaté, they have no idols, and they say
that the human race sprang from stones and
the earth. The men of the stones were <i>Natamoli
nefat</i>, and the men of the earth <i>Natamoli natana</i>.
The native name of the island is Efat or Stone—which
has been corrupted into Vaté. The
principal god is Supu, who created Vaté and
everything on it; and when a person dies, he is
supposed to be taken away by Supu. Ancestor-worship
is also practised, and the aged were
often buried alive at their own request.</p>

<p>The island of Vaté is high above the sea, of an
irregular outline, and distinguished by some fine
bold features. ‘We could see,’ says Mr Brenchley,
‘high mountains, whose summits seemed clad
with verdure, while the thick woods towards
their base formed, as it were, a girdle which
spread downwards as far as the beach.’ Ashore,
he saw high reed-grass, wild sugar-canes ten feet
high, and vast plantations of banana and cocoa-nut.
The soil is of remarkable fertility; but
the island is subject to frequent shocks of earthquake,
sometimes very violent. The climate is
damp, but not unhealthy. Of the natives, we
have read differing accounts, one describing them
as among the best, and another as among the
worst of New Hebridean aborigines, with a remarkably
developed and insatiable craving for
human flesh. The happy mean is probably
near the truth, that is to say, they are neither
better nor worse than the rest of their race, and
are very much as the visitor makes them.</p>

<p class="ph3">BY FRED. M. WHITE.</p></div>


<h3 title="CHAP. XII.">IN TWENTY CHAPTERS.—CHAP. XII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Coolly</span>, as if the whole transaction had been
a little light recreation, and untroubled in conscience,
as if the fatal card had fallen to Maxwell
by pure chance, instead of base trickery, Le
Gautier turned his steps in the direction of
Fitzroy Square. It was a matter of supreme
indifference to him now whether Maxwell obeyed
the dictum of the League or not; indeed, flat
rebellion would have suited his purpose better,
for in that case he would be all the sooner rid
of; and there was just a chance that the affair
with Visci might end favourably; whereas, on
the other hand, a refusal would end fatally for
the rash man who defied the League. Men can
face open danger; it is the uncertainty, the
blind groping in the dark, that wears body and
mind out, unstrings the nerves, and sometimes
unseats reason. Better fight with fearful odds,
than walk out with the shadow of the sword
hanging over one night and day. The inestimable
Frenchman had seen what defiance to the
League generally came to; and as he reviewed
his rosy prospects, his bright thoughts lent
additional flavour to his cigarette. Nevertheless,
his heart beat a trifle faster as he pulled the
bell at the quiet house in Ventnor Street.
Adventures of this sort were nothing novel to
him; but he had something more at stake here
than the fortunes of the little blind boy and
the light intrigue he looked for. Miss St Jean
was in, he found; and he was shown up to
her room, where he sat noting the apartment—the
open piano, and the shaded waxlights, shining
softly—just the proper amount of light to
note charms by, and just dim enough to unite
confidences. As he noted these things, he smiled,
for Le Gautier was a connoisseur in the graceful
art of love-making, and boasted that he could
read women as scholars can expound abstruse
passages of the earlier classics, or think they
can, which pleases them equally. In such like
case, the Frenchman was about to fall into a
similar error, never dreaming that the artistically
arranged room with its shaded lights was
a trap to catch his soul. He waited impatiently
for the coming fair one, knowing full well that
she wished to create an impression. If such was
her intention, she succeeded beyond expectation.</p>

<p>With her magnificent hair piled up upon her
small shapely head, and its glossy blackness
relieved only by a single diamond star, shining
like a planet on the bosom of the midnight
sky, with a radiant smile upon her face, she
came towards him. She was dressed in some
light shimmering material, cut low upon the
shoulders; and round the corsage was a wreath
of deep red roses, a crimson ribbon round the
neck, from which depended a diamond cross.
She came forward murmuring a few well-chosen
words, and sank into a chair, waiting for Le
Gautier to recover.</p>

<p>He had need of time to recover his scattered
senses, for, man of the world as he was, and
acquainted with beauty as he was, he had never
seen anything like this before. But he was not
the sort to be long taken aback; he raised his
eyes to hers with a mute homage which was
more eloquent than words. He began to feel at
home; the dazzling loveliness threw a spell upon
him, the delicious mystery was to his liking; and
he was tête-à-tête.</p>

<p>‘I began to think I had failed to interest
you sufficiently last night,’ Isodore commenced,
waving her fan slowly before her face. ‘I began
to imagine you were not coming to take pity
on my loneliness.’</p>

<p>‘How could you dream such a thing?’ Le
Gautier replied in his most languishing voice.
His pulses began to beat at these last words.
‘Did I not promise to come? I should have
been here long since, but sordid claims of business
detained me from your side.’</p>

<p>‘It must have been pressing business,’ Isodore
laughed archly. ‘And pray, what throne are you
going to rock to its foundations now?’</p>

<p>Had Le Gautier been a trifle less vain, he
would have been on his guard when the conversation
took so personal a turn; but he was flattered;
the question betokened an interest in himself.
‘How would it interest you?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘How do you know that it would not? Remember,
that though I am bound by no oath, I am
one of you. Anything connected with the League,
anything connected with yourself, cannot fail
to interest me.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_708">{708}</span></p>
<p>The words ran through Le Gautier’s frame
like quicksilver. He was impulsive and passionate;
these few minutes had almost sufficed
to seal his thraldom. He began to lose his
head. ‘You flatter me,’ he said joyously. ‘Our
business to-night was short; we only had to
choose an avenging angel.’</p>

<p>‘For Visci, I suppose?’ Isodore observed with
some faint show of interest. ‘Poor man! And
upon whom did the choice fall?’</p>

<p>‘A new member, curiously enough. I do not
know if you are acquainted with him: his name
is Maxwell.’</p>

<p>‘May he prove as true to the cause as—as you
are. I have never had the fortune to be present
on one of these occasions. How do you manage
it? Do you draw lots, or do you settle it with
dice?’</p>

<p>‘On this occasion, no. We have a much fairer
plan than that. We take a pack of cards; they
are counted, to see if they are correct; then each
man present shuffles them; a particular one
represents the fatal number, and the president
of the assembly deals them out. Whoever the
chosen one falls to has to do the task in hand.’</p>

<p>‘That, I suppose, must be fair, unless there
is a conjurer presiding,’ Isodore observed reflectively.—‘Who
was the president to-night?’</p>

<p>‘I myself. I took my chance with the others,
you must understand.’</p>

<p>Isodore did not reply, as she sat there waving
her fan backwards and forwards before her face.
Le Gautier fancied that for a moment a smile
of bitter contempt flashed out from her eyes;
but he dismissed the idea, for, when she dropped
the fan again, her face was clear and smiling.</p>

<p>‘I am wearying you,’ she said, ‘by my silly
questions. A woman who asks questions should
not be allowed in society; she should be shut
away from her fellow-creatures, as a thing to be
avoided. I am no talker myself, at least not
in the sense men mean.—Shall I play to you?’</p>

<p>Le Gautier would have asked nothing better
than to sit there feasting his eyes upon her matchless
beauty; but now he assented eagerly to the
suggestion. Music is an accomplishment which
forces flirtation; besides which, he could stand
close to her side, turning over the leaves with
opportunities which a quiet conversation never
furnishes. Taking him at his word, she sat down
at the instrument and commenced to play. It
might have been brilliant or despicably bad,
opera or oratorio, anything to the listener; he
was far too deeply engrossed in the player to
have any sense alive to the music. Perfectly
collected, she did not fail to note this, and when
she had finished, she looked up in his passionate
face with a glance melting and tender, yet wholly
womanly. It took all Le Gautier’s self-command
to restrain himself from snatching her to his
heart in his madness and covering the dark face
with kisses. He was reckless now, too far gone
to disguise his admiration, and she knew it.
With one final crash upon the keys she rose
from her seat, confronting him.</p>

<p>‘Do not leave off yet,’ he urged, and saying
this, he laid his hand upon her arm. She started,
trembling, as if some deadly thing had stung her.
To her it was a sting; to him, the evidence of
awaking passion, and he, poor fool, felt his heart
beat faster. She sat down again, panting a little,
as from some inward emotion. ‘As you please,’
she said. ‘Shall I sing to you?’</p>

<p>‘Sweeter than the voice of the nightingales to
me!’ he exclaimed passionately. ‘Yes, do sing.
I shall close my eyes, and fancy myself in paradise.’</p>

<p>‘Your imagination must be a powerful one.—Do
you know this?’</p>

<p>Isodore took a piece of music from the stand,
a simple Italian air, and placed it in his hands.
He turned over the leaves carelessly, and returned
it to her with a gesture of denial. There was
a curious smile upon her lips as she sat down
to sing, a smile that puzzled and bewildered him.</p>

<p>‘Do you not know it?’ she asked, when the
last chords died away.</p>

<p>‘Now you have sung it, I think I do. It is
a sentimental sort of thing, do you not think?
A little girl I used to know near Rome sang it
to me. She, I remember, used to imagine it was
my favourite song. She was one of the romantic
schoolgirls, Miss St Jean, and the eyes she used
to make at me when she sang it are something
to be remembered.’</p>

<p>Isodore turned her back sharply and searched
among the music. If he could only have seen
the bitter scorn in the face then—scorn partly
for him, and wholly for herself. But again she
steeled herself.</p>

<p>‘I daresay you gave her some cause, Monsieur
Le Gautier,’ she said. ‘You men of the world,
flitting from place to place, think nothing of
breaking a country heart or two. You may not
mean it, perhaps, but so it is.’</p>

<p>‘Hearts do not break so easily,’ Le Gautier
replied lightly. ‘Perhaps I did give the child
some cause, as you say. <i>Pardieu!</i> a man tied
down in a country village must amuse himself,
and a little unsophisticated human nature is a
pleasant chance. She was a little spitfire, I
remember, and when I left, could not see the
matter in a reasonable light. There is still some
bitter vengeance awaiting me, if I am to believe
her words.’</p>

<p>‘Then you had best beware. A woman’s heart
is a dangerous plaything,’ Isodore replied. ‘Do
you never feel sorry, never experience a pang of
conscience after such a thing as that? Surely,
at times you must regret?’</p>

<p>‘I have heard of such a thing as conscience,’
Le Gautier put in airily; ‘but I must have been
born before they came into fashion. No, Miss
St Jean, I cannot afford to indulge in luxuries.’</p>

<p>‘And the League takes up so much of your
time. And that reminds me. We have said
nothing yet about your insignia. I may tell you
now that it is not yet in my hands; but I shall
obtain it for you. How bold, how reckless you
were that night, and yet I do not wonder! At
times, the sense of restraint must bear heavy upon
a man of spirit.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, from the bottom of my heart,’
Le Gautier fervently exclaimed. ‘You are too
good to me.—Yes,’ he continued, ‘there are times
when I feel the burden sorely—times like the
present, let us say, when I have a foretaste of
happier things. If I had you by my side, I
could defy the world.’</p>

<p>Isodore looked at him and laughed, her wonderful
magnetic smile making her eyes aglow and
full of dazzling tints.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_709">{709}</span></p>
<p>‘That could not be,’ she said. ‘I would have
no divided attentions; I would have a man’s
whole heart, or nothing. I have too long been
alone in the world not to realise what a full meed
of affection means.’</p>

<p>‘You should have all mine!’ Le Gautier cried,
carried away by the torrent of his passions. ‘No
longer should the League bind me. I would be
free, if it cost ten thousand lives! No chains
should hold me then, for, by heaven, I would not
hesitate to betray it!’</p>

<p>‘Hush, hush!’ Isodore exclaimed in a startled
whisper. ‘You do not understand what you are
saying. You do not comprehend the meaning
of your words. Would you betray the Brotherhood?’</p>

<p>‘Ay, if you but say the word—ten thousand
Brotherhoods.’</p>

<p>‘I am not bound by solemn oath like you,’
Isodore replied sadly; ‘and at times I think it
could never do good. It is too dark and mysterious
and too violent to my taste; but you are
bound in honour.’</p>

<p>‘But suppose I was to come to you and say
I was free?’ Le Gautier asked hoarsely. ‘To
tell you that my hands were no longer fettered—what
words would you have to say to me then—Marie?’
He hesitated before he uttered the
last word, dwelling upon it in an accent of the
deepest tenderness. Apparently, Isodore did not
notice, for her eyes were sad, her thoughts evidently
far away.</p>

<p>‘I do not know what I should say to you—in
time.’</p>

<p>‘Your words are like new life to me,’ Le
Gautier exclaimed; ‘they give me hope and
strength, and in my undertaking I shall succeed.’</p>

<p>‘You will do nothing rash, nothing headstrong,
without telling me. Let me know when
you are coming to see me again, and we will talk
the matter over; but I fear, without treachery,
you never can be free.’</p>

<p>‘Anything to be my own master!’ he retorted
fervently.—‘Good-night, and remember that any
step I may take will be for you.’ With a long
lingering pressure of the hand and many burning
glances, he was gone.</p>

<p>Isodore heard his retreating footsteps echoing
down the stairs, and thence along the silent
street. The mask fell from her face; she clenched
her hands, and her countenance was crossed
with a hundred angry passions. Valerie entering
at that moment, looked at her with something
like fear.</p>

<p>‘Sit down, Valerie,’ Isodore whispered hoarsely,
in a voice like the tones of one in great pain,
as she walked impatiently about the room, her
hands twisted together convulsively. ‘Do not be
afraid; I shall be better presently. I feel as if
I want to scream, or do some desperate thing
to-night. He has been here, Valerie; how I
sustained myself, I cannot tell.’</p>

<p>‘Did he recognise you?’ Valerie asked timidly.</p>

<p>‘Recognise me? No, indeed! He spoke about
the old days by the Mattio woods, the old times
when we were together, and laughed at me for
a romantic schoolgirl. I nearly stabbed him
then. There is treachery afloat; his plan is
prospering. As I told you it would be, Maxwell
is chosen for the Roman mission; but he will
never do the deed, for I shall warn Visci myself.
And he was my bro——Visci’s friend!’</p>

<p>‘But what are you going to do now?’ Valerie
asked.</p>

<p>‘He is a traitor. He is going to betray the
League, and I am going to be his confidant. I
saw it in his face. I wonder how I bear it—I
wonder I do not die! What would they say
if they saw Isodore now?—Come, Valerie, come
and hold me tightly in your arms—tighter still.
If I do not have a little pity, my poor heart
will break.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Long and earnestly did Salvarini and Maxwell
sit in the latter’s studio discussing the events of
the evening, till the fire had burnt down to
ashes and the clock in the neighbouring steeple
struck three. It was settled that Maxwell
should go to Rome, though with what ulterior
object they did not decide. Time was in his
favour, the lapse of a month or so in the commission
being a matter of little object to the
League. They preferred that vengeance should
be deferred for a time, and that the blow might
be struck when it was least expected, when the
victim was just beginning to imagine himself
safe and the matter forgotten.</p>

<p>‘I suppose I had better lose no time in going?’
Maxwell observed, when they had discussed the
matter thoroughly. ‘Time and distance are no
objects to me, or money either.’</p>

<p>‘As to your time of departure, I should say
as soon as possible,’ Salvarini replied; ‘and as
to money, the League finds that.’</p>

<p>‘I would not touch a penny of it, Luigi—no,
not if I was starving. I could not soil my fingers
with their blood-money.—What do you say to
my starting on Monday night? I could get to
Rome by Thursday morning at the latest.—And
yet, to what good? I almost feel inclined to
refuse, and bid them do their worst.’</p>

<p>‘For heaven’s sake, do not!’ Salvarini implored.
‘Such a thing is worse than folly. If
you assume a readiness to fulfil your undertaking,
something may turn up in your favour.’
Maxwell gazed moodily in the dead ashes,
and cursed the hot-headed haste which had
placed him in that awful position. Like every
right-minded man, he shrank with horror from
such a cowardly crime.</p>

<p>‘You will never attain your ends,’ he said.
‘Your cause is a noble one; but true liberty, perfect
freedom, turns against cold-blooded murder;
for call it what you will, it is nothing else.’</p>

<p>‘You are right, my friend,’ Salvarini mournfully
replied. ‘No good can come of it; and
when reprisals come, as they must, they shall be
swift and terrible.—But Frederick,’ he continued,
laying his hand on the other’s shoulder, ‘do not
blame me too deeply, for I will lay down my
own life cheerfully before harm shall come to
you.’</p>

<p>Maxwell was not aware that Sir Geoffrey
Charteris was a member of the League, as Le
Gautier had taken care to keep them apart,
so far as business matters were concerned, only
allowing the baronet to attend such meetings
as were perfectly harmless in their general character,
and calculated to inspire him with admiration
of the philanthropic schemes and self-denying
usefulness of the Brotherhood; nor was it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_710">{710}</span>the Frenchman’s intention to admit him any
deeper into its secrets; indeed, his admission
only formed part of the scheme by which the
baronet, and through him his daughter, should
be entirely in the Frenchman’s power. The
cards were sorted, and, once Maxwell was out
of the way, the game was ready to be played.
All this the artist did not know.</p>

<p>With a heavy heart and a foreboding of coming
evil, he made the simple preparations for his
journey. He had delayed to the last the task
of informing Enid of his departure, partly from
a distaste of alarming her, and partly out of fear.
It would look more natural, he thought, to break
it suddenly, merely saying he had been called
to Rome on pressing business, and that his
absence would not be a prolonged one. Till
Saturday, he put this off, and then, bracing up
his nerves, he got into his cab, and was driven
off rapidly in the direction of Grosvenor Square.
He was roused from his meditations by a shock
and a crash, the sound of broken glass, the sight
of two plunging horses on the ground—roused
by being shot forward violently, by the shouts
of the crowd, and above all, by the piercing
scream of a woman’s voice. Scrambling out as
best he could, he rose to his feet and looked
around. His cab had come violently in collision
with another in the centre of Piccadilly.
A woman had attempted to cross hurriedly; and
the two cabs had swerved suddenly, coming
together sharply, but not too late to save the
woman, who was lying there, in the centre of
an eager, excited crowd, perfectly unconscious,
the blood streaming down her white face, and
staining her light summer dress. A doctor had
raised her a little, and was trying to force some
brandy between the clenched teeth, as Maxwell
pushed his way through the crowd.</p>

<p>‘Nothing very serious,’ he said, in answer to
Maxwell’s question. ‘She is simply stunned by
the blow, and has sustained, I should say, a
simple fracture of the right arm. She must be
moved from here at once.—If you will call a
cab, I will take her to a hospital.’</p>

<p>‘No, no!’ Maxwell cried, moved to pity by
the pale fair face and slight girlish figure. ‘I
am mainly responsible for the accident, and you
must allow me to be the best judge. My cab,
you see, is almost uninjured; put her in there,
and I will tell you where to drive.’</p>

<p>They lifted the unconscious girl and placed
her tenderly on the seat. There were warm
hearts and sympathetic hands there, as you may
notice on such occasions as these, and there was
a look of feeling in every face as the cab drove
slowly away.</p>

<p>‘Go on to Grosvenor Square,’ Maxwell instructed
his man. ‘Drive slowly up New Bond
Street. We shall be there as soon as you.’</p>

<p>They arrived at Sir Geoffrey’s house together,
considerably astonishing the footman, as, without
ceremony, they carried the sufferer in. Alarmed
by strange voices and the shrieks of the servants,
who had come up at the first alarm, Enid made
her appearance to demand the meaning of this
unseemly noise; but directly she heard the
cause, as coherently as Maxwell could tell her,
her face changed, and she became at once all
tenderness and womanly sympathy.</p>

<p>‘I knew you would not mind, darling,’ he
whispered gratefully. ‘I hardly knew what to
do, and it was partly my fault.’</p>

<p>‘You did quite right. Of course I do not
mind. Fred, what do you take me for?’ She
knelt down beside the injured woman there in
the hall, in the presence of all the servants, and
helped to carry her up the stairs.</p>

<p>Lucrece looked on for a moment, and then
a startled look came in her face. ‘Ah!’ she
exclaimed, ‘I know that face—it is Linda
Despard.’</p>

<p>Enid heard these words, but did not heed
them at the time. They carried the girl into
one of the rooms and laid her on the bed. At
a sign from the doctor, the room was cleared,
with the exception of Enid and Lucrece, and
the medical man proceeded to look to the broken
limb. It was only a very simple fracture, he
said. The gravest danger was from the shock
to the system and the wound upon the forehead.
Presently, they got her comfortably in
bed, breathing regularly, and apparently asleep.
The good-natured doctor, waving aside all thanks,
left the room, promising to call again later in
the day.</p>




<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop"><div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak" id="FOUNDLING_QUOTATIONS">FOUNDLING QUOTATIONS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Quotations</span> play no small part in conversation
and general literature. There are some which we
know must inevitably be made under certain circumstances.
It is almost impossible, for instance,
for the conventional novelist, when he wants to
convey to his readers the fact that his heroine’s
nose is of a particular order—which, formerly,
through our lack of invention, we could only
describe by a somewhat ungraceful term—to avoid
quoting Lord Tennyson’s description of the feature
as it graced Lynette’s fair face—‘Tip-tilted like the
petal of a flower.’ We feel sure that it must come;
and there is now, happily, no occasion for a young
lady in the position of one of Miss Braddon’s
earlier heroines, when listening to a detailed
description of her appearance, to interrupt the
speaker, as he is about to mention the characteristics
of her nose, with a beseeching, ‘Please,
don’t say <i>pug</i>!’</p>

<p>And then, does anybody ever expect to read
a description of a certain celebrated Scotch ruin,
without being told that</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">If thou wouldst view fair Melrose aright,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Go visit it by the pale moonlight?</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>or to get through an account of the ancient gladiatorial
games at Rome without coming across the
line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">Butchered to make a Roman holiday?</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>You know, perhaps, what praise Mark Twain took
to himself because he did <i>not</i> quote this line. ‘If
any man has a right,’ he says, ‘to feel proud of
himself and satisfied, surely it is I; for I have
written about the Coliseum, and the gladiators,
the martyrs, and the lions, and yet have never
used the phrase, “Butchered to make a Roman
holiday.” I am the only free white man of
mature age who has accomplished this since Byron
originated the expression.’ This little piece of
self-congratulation rather reminds one of the lady
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_711">{711}</span>who was accused of never being able to write a
letter without adding a P.S. At last, she managed
to write one without the usual addition; but
when she saw what she had succeeded in doing,
she wrote: ‘P.S.—At last, you see, I have written
a letter without a P.S.’ And so, though Mark
Twain managed to steer clear of the hackneyed
quotation in the body of his account, he could
not help running against it in a P.S.</p>

<p>Then we have all the multitude of Shaksperean
quotations which are sure to be heard in their
accustomed places, many of which, indeed, have
become—to quote again—such ‘household words,’
that to very many people they do not appear to
be quotations at all, but merely every-day expressions,
of the same order as ‘A fine day’ or ‘A
biting wind.’</p>

<p>Again, when we read of some cheerful fireside
scene, when the curtains are drawn closely against
the winter wind that is roaring round the house,
and the logs are crackling and spitting in the
grate, and the urn is hissing and steaming upon
the table, don’t we know that a reference to the
‘cup which cheers but not inebriates’ is certainly
coming? This, by the way, is a line that is
almost invariably incorrectly quoted, and it is
the usual and incorrect form that we have given.
We shall leave our readers to turn up the line
for themselves, and see what the correct form is,
and then, perhaps, the trouble they will thereby
have had will serve to impress it upon their
minds, and prevent them again quoting it incorrectly.</p>

<p>But it was not with the intention of talking
about these well-known and every-day quotations
from Tennyson, Scott, Byron, Shakspeare, and
Cowper that we thought of writing this paper.
We want to talk about a few quotations, quite as
well known as those to which we have already
alluded, which have been so bandied about that
all trace, or nearly all trace, of their original
parish and paternity has been lost; and, though
they are as familiar to us as the most hackneyed
phrases from our best known poets, no one can
say with certainty by whom they were first
spoken or written.</p>

<p>A good many wagers have been made as to
the source of the well-known and much-quoted
couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">He that fights and runs away,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">May live to fight another day.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>The popular belief is that they are to be found
in Butler’s <i>Hudibras</i>. But the pages of that poem
may be turned over and over again, and the
lines will not be found in them. We may as well
say at once that they cannot be found anywhere
in the exact form in which they are usually
quoted. The late Mr James Yeowell, formerly sub-editor
of <i>Notes and Queries</i>, once thought that he
had discovered their author in Oliver Goldsmith,
as a couplet, varying very slightly from the form
we have given, occurs in <i>The Art of Poetry on a
New Plan</i>, which was compiled by Newbery—the
children’s publisher—more than a century ago,
and revised and enlarged by Goldsmith. But the
lines are to be found in a book that was published
some thirteen years before <i>The Art of Poetry</i>,
namely, Ray’s <i>History of the Rebellion</i>. There
they appear as a quotation, and no hint is given
as to the source from which they are taken.
Ray gives them as follows (first edition, 1749,
page 54):</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">He that fights and runs away,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">May turn and fight another day.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Though this is the earliest appearance in print
of the exact words, or almost the exact words, in
which the quotation is now usually given, it is by
no means the earliest appearance of a similar
thought. Even as far back as Demosthenes we
find it. It appears, too, in Scarron, in his
<i>Virgile Travesti</i>, if we remember rightly. And
now we must confess that the still prevailing
belief that the lines occur in <i>Hudibras</i> is not
entirely without a <i>raison d’être</i>, and it is not
impossible that Ray may have thought he was
quoting Butler, preserving some hazy and indistinct
recollection of lines read long ago, and
putting their meaning, perhaps quite unwittingly
and unconsciously, into a new and unauthorised
form. This, however, is mere conjecture. The
lines, as they appear in <i>Hudibras</i> (part iii. canto
iii., lines 243, 244), are as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">For those that fly, may fight again,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Which he can never do that’s slain.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>We may just add that Collet, in his <i>Relics of
Literature</i>, says that the couplet occurs in a
small volume of miscellaneous poems by Sir
John Mennis, written in the reign of Charles II.
With this book, however, we are unacquainted,
and cannot, therefore, discuss the appearance of
the foundling lines in it, or what claims its
author may have to be their legitimate parent.</p>

<p>All readers of Tennyson—and who that reads
at all is not numbered amongst them?—know
well the opening stanza of <i>In Memoriam</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">I held it truth, with him who sings</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To one clear harp in divers tones,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">That men may rise on stepping-stones</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Of their dead selves to higher things.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>These lines contain another quotation of the
order we have designated as ‘Foundling Quotations.’
Who is the singer, ‘to one clear harp
in divers tones,’ to whom Lord Tennyson refers?
Passages from Seneca and from St Augustine
(Bishop of Hippo) have been suggested as inspiring
the poet when he penned the lines; but
neither Seneca nor St Augustine can be said to
<i>sing</i> ‘to one clear harp in divers tones.’ Perhaps
the most reasonable hypothesis is that Lord
Tennyson had in his mind Longfellow’s beautiful
poem of <i>St Augustine’s Ladder</i>, the opening lines
of which are:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">Saint Augustine! well hast thou said,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">That of our vices we can frame</div>
<div class="verse indent0">A ladder, if we will but tread</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Beneath our feet each deed of shame!</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>and the closing ones:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">Nor deem the irrevocable Past</div>
<div class="verse indent2">As wholly wasted, wholly vain,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">If, rising on its wrecks, at last</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To something nobler we attain.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>The question, however, though Lord Tennyson
is still alive, is one that is not likely ever to be
clearly solved; for we have very good authority
for saying that he has himself quite forgotten
of what poet or verses he was thinking when
he composed the first stanza of <i>In Memoriam</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_712">{712}</span></p>
<p>The equally well-known</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent18">This is truth the poet sings,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">That a sorrow’s crown of sorrow is remembering happier things,</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>in <i>Locksley Hall</i>, refers, of course, to the line in
Dante’s <i>Inferno</i>.</p>

<p>The trite ‘Not lost, but gone before,’ might
alone provide subject-matter for a fairly long
essay. Like the other quotations which we are
discussing, it can be definitely assigned to no
author. The thought can be traced back as far
as the time of Antiphanes, a portion of whose
eleventh ‘fragment,’ Cumberland has translated,
fairly literally, as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">Your lost friends are not dead, but gone before,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Advanced a stage or two upon that road</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Which you must travel, in the steps they trod.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Seneca, in his ninety-ninth Epistle, says:
‘Quem putas periisse, præmissus est’ (He whom
you think dead has been sent on before); and he
also has: ‘Non amittuntur, sed præmittuntur’
(They are not lost, but are sent on before),
which corresponds very closely with the popular
form of the quotation. Cicero has the remark
that ‘Friends, though absent, are still present;’
and it is very probable that it is to this phrase
of Cicero that we are really indebted for the
modern, ‘Not lost, but gone before.’ We may
note that Rogers, in his <i>Human Life</i>, has, ‘Not
dead, but gone before.’</p>

<p>Then there is the somewhat similar, ‘Though
lost to sight, to memory dear,’ which no one
has succeeded in satisfactorily tracing to its
original source. It was said, some years ago,
that the line was to be found in a poem published
in a journal whose name was given as
<i>The Greenwich Magazine</i>, in 1701, and written by
one Ruthven Jenkyns. The words formed the
refrain of each stanza of the poem. We give one
of them as a sample:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">Sweetheart, good-bye! the fluttering sail</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Is spread to waft me far from thee;</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And soon before the fav’ring gale</div>
<div class="verse indent0">My ship shall bound upon the sea.</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Perchance all desolate and forlorn,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">These eyes shall miss thee many a year,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">But unforgotten every charm—</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Though lost to sight, to memory dear.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Mr Bartlett, however, in the last edition of his
<i>Dictionary of Quotations</i>, has demolished this
story of Mr Ruthven Jenkyns; and the line is
still unclaimed and fatherless. Probably, as in
the case of the last mentioned, ‘Not lost, but
gone before,’ its germ is to be found in an
expression of Cicero.</p>

<p>There is a Latin line familiar to all of us,
‘Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis’
(The times change, and we change with them),
which we are frequently hearing and seeing.
This is a much-abused line; probably there is
none more so; and we do not think we shall
be guilty of exaggeration if we say that it is
misquoted ten times for every time it is correctly
cited. The positions of the <i>nos</i> and the <i>et</i> are
usually interchanged; the result being, of course,
a false quantity; for the line is a hexameter.
Now, who first wrote this line? The answer
must be, as in the cases of all our other ‘Foundling
Quotations,’ that we do not know. But in
this particular instance we may venture to be
a little more certain and definite in our remarks
concerning its pedigree than we have dared to
be in previous ones. There can be little doubt
that the line is a corruption of one to be found
in the <i>Delitiæ Poetarum Germanorum</i> (vol. i.
page 685), amongst the poems of Matthias Borbonius,
who considers it a saying of Lotharius I.,
who flourished, as the phrase goes, about 830 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
We give the correct form of the line in question,
and the one which follows it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">Omnia mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis;</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Illa vices quasdem res habet, illa suas.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>There is another foundling Latin line, almost
as frequently quoted as the one we have just
been discussing, namely, ‘Quos Deus vult perdere,
prius dementat’ (Whom the gods would
destroy, they first madden). Concerning this there
is a note in the fifth chapter of the eighth volume
of Mr Croker’s edition of Boswell’s <i>Life of
Johnson</i>, in which it is said to be a translation
from a Greek iambic of Euripides, which is
quoted; but no such line is to be found amongst
the writings of Euripides. Words, however,
expressing the same sentiment are to be found
in a fragment of Athenagoras; and it is most
likely that the Latin phrase now so commonly
quoted is merely a translation from this writer’s
Greek, though by whom it was first made we
cannot say. The same sentiment has been expressed
more than once in English poetry.</p>

<p>Dryden, in the third part of <i>The Hind and
the Panther</i>, has:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">For those whom God to ruin has designed,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">He fits for fate, and first destroys their mind.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>And Butler writes in <i>Hudibras</i> (part iii. canto
ii., lines 565, 566):</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">Like men condemned to thunder-bolts,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Who, ere the blow, become mere dolts.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Further consideration will probably bring to
the reader’s mind other examples of these
‘Foundling Quotations’ which have won for themselves
an imperishable existence; though their
authors, whose names these few-syllabled sentences
might have kept alive for ever, if they
were only linked the one with the other, are
now utterly unknown and forgotten. Any one
who can succeed in discovering the real authorship
of the quotations we have been considering
will win for himself the credit of having solved
problems which have long and persistently baffled
the most curious and diligent research.</p>

<h3 title="CHAP. I.">IN TWO CHAPTERS.—CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Phœbe Masterman</span> was a spinster over
whose head some fifty summers had flown—with,
it may be presumed, incredible swiftness
to herself. She was very comfortably situated
with regard to this world’s goods, having inherited
ample means from her father, a native of
Durham, who had made a considerable fortune
as a coal-merchant. At the time of her father’s
death, she was thirty-five; and as she had no
near relative in whom to interest herself, she
established an Orphanage for twelve girls at
Bradborough, a market-town in the north of
England, within two miles of the coast. Brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_713">{713}</span>up in the strictest conformity with Miss Masterman’s
peculiar views, dressed with the most rigid
simplicity, fed on the plainest fare, taught to
look upon the mildest forms of recreation as
vanity and vexation of spirit, these fortunate
orphans, one would think, could hardly fail to
become virtuous and happy; yet, inconceivable
as it may appear, there were legends that orphans
had been seen with red eyes and countenances
expressive of anything but content; there was
even a dark rumour to the effect that one of
them had been heard to declare that if she only
had the opportunity she would gladly commit
a crime, that she might be sent to prison, and
so escape from the thraldom of Miss Masterman!</p>

<p>But even this ingratitude and depravity paled
before that of the Rev. Shanghan Lambe, incumbent
of the little church of St Mary’s. Now,
Miss Masterman had built that church for the
good of the district, and the living was in her
own gift. Yet Mr Lambe, entirely ignoring the
latter fact, had had the hardihood to baptise
an orphan in Miss Masterman’s absence without
previously obtaining the permission of that lady;
upon which the indignant lady declared that
unless he promised not to interfere with her
orphans, she would withdraw all her subscriptions
and leave him to find his own income.
Nor was this all. There were other reasons to
make Mr Lambe pause before quarrelling with
Miss Masterman. Before he was appointed to
St Mary’s, he had been only a poor curate with
a stipend of fifty pounds a year, which munificent
income he had found totally inadequate
to his wants and those of an aged mother who
was dependent on him; consequently, he had
entered upon his duties at Bradborough shackled
with small debts to the amount of a hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>Miss Masterman, who made a point of
inquiring into every one’s affairs, soon became
aware of this, and as want of generosity was
by no means to be numbered among her failings,
she rightly judged that it would not be reasonable
to expect a man to give his mind to his
work if he were weighed down by other cares;
so, in an evil hour for himself, poor Mr Lambe
accepted from the lady a sum of money sufficient
to defray his debts—a sum for which, as he
soon found, he would have to pay compound
interest in the way of blind obedience to Miss
Masterman’s behests. Not a funeral could be
performed, not a marriage could be solemnised,
not an infant could be baptised, without Miss
Masterman’s permission; and it was even asserted
by some that Miss Masterman selected the texts
for the poor man’s sermons! The only oasis in
his desert was the annual departure of Miss
Masterman for change of air; then, and then
only, did Mr Lambe breathe in peace. For a
brief period, he felt that he was really master
of himself. He could sit down and smoke his
pipe without fear that his sitting-room door
would be rudely flung open by an imperious
female of fierce aspect, who would lecture him
on his sinful extravagance in the use of tobacco,
when he couldn’t pay his debts.</p>

<p>One bright August morning, Miss Masterman
was seated at her breakfast table, and having
concluded her meal, had taken up the morning
paper and was studying the advertisements,
holding the paper at arm’s-length with an air
of grim combativeness, as if she were prepared
to give battle to any or all the advertisers who
did not offer exactly what she sought. Suddenly,
she pounced upon the following: ‘A Home is
offered in a Country Rectory by a Rector and
his family for two or three months to a Single
Lady needing change of air. House, with large
grounds, conservatories, pony-carriage, beautiful
scenery.—Address, Rector, <i>Clerical Times Office</i>.’</p>

<p>‘That will do,’ said Miss Masterman to herself;
and, with her usual promptitude, she sat
down then and there and wrote to the advertiser,
asking particulars as to terms, &amp;c. And
in due course she received an answer so perfectly
satisfactory in every respect, that the end
of the month found her comfortably installed
in the charming rectory of Sunnydale, in the
county of Hampshire, in the family of the Rev.
Stephen Draycott, rector of Sunnydale.</p>

<p>The rector’s family, besides himself and his
wife, consisted of two sons and two daughters,
all grown up, with the exception of Master
Hubert, a boy of ten years old, who was endowed
with such a remarkable fund of animal spirits
that he was the terror of the neighbourhood; and
from the first moment of Miss Masterman’s arrival,
he became the special <i>bête noire</i> of that lady.
With all the other members of the family, Miss
Masterman was much pleased. The rector himself
was a polished and dignified person, and
by the extreme, if rather laboured, courtesy
of his manners, he endeavoured to tone down
the somewhat exuberant spirits of the rest of
his family. Mrs Draycott was a gentle, refined
matron, with a sweet, though rather weary face,
and was simply adored by her husband and
children. The two daughters, Adela and Magdalen,
were charming girls, full of fun, and very
popular with their two brothers, of whom the
senior, Clive, was aged nineteen.</p>

<p>To the young people, Miss Masterman’s
arrival was little short of a calamity; they were
so much in the habit of freely stating their
opinions on all subjects without restraint, that
the presence of a stranger appeared to them an
unmitigated bore. It was in vain that their
mother reminded them that the handsome sum
paid by Miss Masterman for her board would
be a very desirable addition to the family
exchequer. At a sort of cabinet council held
after she had retired to her room the first
night after her arrival, Master Hubert expressed,
in schoolboy slang, his conviction that she was
a ‘ghastly old crumpet;’ a nickname which she
retained until a servant one day brought in a
letter which, she said, was addressed to ‘Miss
Pobe Masterman;’ from which moment, Miss
Masterman went by the name of ‘Pobe’ till
the end of her visit—a piece of irreverence of
which that lady happily remained quite unconscious.</p>

<p>By the time Miss Masterman had settled down
in her new abode, the principal ladies of the
parish came to call upon her; and as some
of them were not only rich but very highly
connected, Miss Masterman greatly appreciated
their kind attentions. Among them was a Lady
O’Leary, an Irish widow, with whom Miss
Masterman soon struck up a great intimacy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_714">{714}</span>Lady O’Leary was generally believed to be a
person of large fortune; but as this supposition
was based entirely on her own representations
with regard to property in Ireland, there were
some sceptical spirits who declined to believe in
it as an established fact. Lady O’Leary shared
three furnished rooms with a Miss Moone, who
lived with her as companion; and it soon
became quite an institution for Miss Masterman
to take tea with her two or three times a
week at least. On these occasions, the two
ladies—for Miss Moone discreetly withdrew
when Lady O’Leary had visitors—discussed all
the affairs of the parish, until, by degrees, they
got upon such thoroughly confidential terms, that
before long they had imparted to each other
their joint conviction that the general moral tone
of the parish was lamentably low, and that it
was doubtless owing in a great measure to the
deplorably frivolous conduct of the family at the
rectory; for Miss Masterman had discovered, to
her amazement and horror, that the rector not
only permitted his daughters to read Shakspeare,
but even gave them direct encouragement to do
so. Nor was this all; he actually was in the
habit, once a year, of taking all his children
up to London to see the pantomime at Drury
Lane!</p>

<p>Among the more frequent visitors at the rectory
was a Mrs Penrose, an exceedingly pretty young
widow, who had recently taken a small house
in the village, where she lived very quietly with
an old servant, who appeared greatly attached to
her mistress. The widow, who was apparently
not more than five-and-twenty, was a charming
brunette, with sparkling black eyes, and hair like
waves of shining brown satin; and her sweet
face and animated manners made her generally
very popular in the village, where she visited the
poor and assisted the rector in various parochial
works of charity. Especially was she a favourite
at the rectory, not only with Mr and Mrs
Draycott, but with the young people, her presence
in the family circle invariably giving rise
to so much hilarity, that even the rector was
attracted by the general merriment, and would
leave his study to come and sit with his family,
and allow himself to join in their mirth at Mrs
Penrose’s lively sallies. Indeed, he had even been
heard to declare, in Miss Masterman’s hearing,
to that lady’s unspeakable disgust, that when
he was fagged and worried with the necessary
work of a parish, a few minutes of Mrs Penrose’s
cheerful society acted on his mind like a
tonic.</p>

<p>Miss Masterman, from the first, had taken an
extraordinary antipathy to Mrs Penrose, who
appeared to her to be everything that a widow
ought not to be! Her bright face and unflagging
spirits were a constant offence to the elder lady,
though she had often been told that the late
Captain Penrose was such a worthless man that
his early death, brought about entirely by his
own excesses, could be nothing but an intense
relief to his young widow, who was now enjoying
the reaction, after five years of married misery.
Miss Masterman’s dislike to Mrs Penrose was
fully shared by her friend Lady O’Leary; and
they both agreed that the widow was in all
probability a designing adventuress, and deplored
the infatuation which evidently blinded the rector
as to her real character, for, as Lady O’Leary
observed: ‘Though it was given out that Mrs
Penrose was the particular friend of <i>Mrs</i> Draycott,
the rector’s partiality was obvious!’</p>

<p>Miss Masterman had been at Sunnydale for
six weeks, when one morning she received a
letter from her housekeeper, informing her that
Mr Lambe had taken upon himself to remark
that the orphans were looking pale and jaded,
and that he was going to take them all to spend a
day at the seaside. Miss Masterman, on reading
this letter, felt most indignant, and at once wrote
to Mr Lambe to forbid the proposed excursion;
and after enumerating the many obligations under
which she had laid him—not forgetting the hundred
pounds she had lent him—she concluded
by expressing her surprise that he should presume
to interfere with her special protégées in
any way whatever.</p>

<p>To this Mr Lambe replied that he was
‘extremely sorry if he had offended Miss Masterman;
that he had imagined that she would be
pleased for the orphans to have the treat, particularly
as some of them looked far from well;
but that, having promised the children, it was
impossible for him to break his word, particularly
as he had ordered a van for their conveyance
and made all the necessary arrangements
for the trip; he therefore trusted that Miss
Masterman would forgive him if he still kept
his promise to his little friends.’</p>

<p>Furious at this unexpected opposition to her
will, Miss Masterman at once went in search of
Mrs Draycott to inform her that it was necessary
for her to go home for a week or ten days
on business of importance. Finding that Mrs
Draycott was not at home, she repaired to the
rector’s study, and after knocking at the door,
and being told to enter, she informed Mr Draycott
of her intentions. Saying that she must
write home at once, she was about to withdraw,
when Mr Draycott courteously asked her if she
would not write in the study, to save time,
as he was just going out. Miss Masterman
thanked him; and as soon as he had gone, sat
down and wrote to her housekeeper to say that
she would be at home the following day without
fail. Having finished her letter, she was about
to leave the room, when she observed a note
in a lady’s handwriting, which had apparently
slipped out of the blotting-pad on to the floor.
She picked it up, and was about to return it to
its place, when the signature, ‘Florence Penrose,’
caught her eye. ‘What can that frivolous being
have to say to the rector?’ thought Miss Masterman;
and feeling that her curiosity was too
strong to be resisted, she unfolded the note, and
read the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>—I have just received the
diamonds, which are exactly what I wanted. The
baby’s cloak and hood will do very well. I have
now nearly all that I require. My only terror
is, lest our secret should be discovered.—In great
haste. Yours, as ever,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Florence Penrose</span>.<br>
</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>—I hope you won’t forget to supply me
with plenty of flowers.</p>
</div>

<p>Here was a discovery! For a few moments
Miss Masterman sat motionless with horror; her
head was in a whirl, and she had to collect her
thoughts before she could make up her mind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_715">{715}</span>what to do. The first definite idea that occurred
to her was to secure the note; the next was, to
show it to Lady O’Leary and to discuss with
her what was to be done. As soon, therefore,
as she had completed all her arrangements for
her journey on the morrow, she repaired to her
friend’s lodgings; and after Lady O’Leary had
fairly exhausted all the expletives that even her
extensive Irish vocabulary could supply, to express
her horror and detestation of the conduct
of the rector and Mrs Penrose, the two ladies
laid their heads together, and seriously discussed
the advisability of writing to the bishop of the
diocese and sending him the incriminating letter.
However, they finally decided to do nothing
before Miss Masterman’s return to Sunnydale;
and in the meantime, Lady O’Leary undertook
to be on the watch, and to keep her friend
<i>au courant</i> as to what was going on in the
parish.</p>

<p>It was late that evening when Miss Masterman
returned to the rectory, and by going up directly
to her room, she avoided meeting the rector. The
next morning she pleaded headache as an excuse
for having her breakfast sent up to her; and did
not come down until, from her window, she
had seen Mr Draycott leave the house, knowing
he would be away for some hours. He left
a polite message with his wife, regretting that
he had not been able to say good-bye in person
to Miss Masterman.</p>

<p>‘The wily hypocrite!’ thought that lady.
‘He little thinks that his guilt is no secret to
me. But such atrocity shall not go unpunished!’</p>

<p>When she took leave of Mrs Draycott, she
astonished that lady by holding her hand for
some moments as she gazed mournfully into her
face; then, with a final commiserating glance,
the worthy spinster hurried into her fly. As
she drove away, she leant forward and waved
her hand to the assembled family with such
effusion, that Mrs Draycott exclaimed: ‘Dear
me, I fear I have done Miss Masterman injustice.
I had no idea that she possessed so much feeling
as she showed just now. One would really
think she was going for good, instead of only
ten days!’</p>

<p>‘No such luck,’ cried the irrepressible Hubert.
‘But, at all events, we have got rid of her for
a week at least; so now, we’ll enjoy ourselves,
and forget all about “Pobe” till she turns up
again!’—a resolution which the young gentleman
did not fail to keep most faithfully.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Miss Masterman was busily
employed at Bradborough in quelling orphans
and other myrmidons, and reducing things in
general to complete subjection to her will; but
with regard to Mr Lambe, she found her task
more difficult than she expected. In fact, the
worm had turned; and on her summoning him
to her presence and opening the vials of her
wrath on his devoted head, he calmly but firmly
announced his intention of sending his resignation
to his bishop; which took Miss Masterman
so completely by surprise, that, in her bewilderment,
she actually asked him to reconsider his
decision. But though she even went so far as
to give her consent to the orphans having their
coveted treat, Mr Lambe’s determination was not
to be shaken.</p>

<p>The following week flew swiftly away; a good
deal of correspondence devolved upon Miss Masterman
through having to think of a successor
to Mr Lambe, and the lady of the manor was
very much worried. At last, however, everything
was settled, and Miss Masterman began to
think of returning to Sunnydale, where, as she
felt, fresh anxieties and most painful duties
awaited her.</p>

<h3><i>DEEDS OF GIFT AND WILLS.—I.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most universally believed fallacies
is that it is better to make a deed of gift than
a will for the disposal of property. Nothing
can be more dangerous than this delusion, as
we have often had occasion to observe in the
course of our experience. A deed of gift—pure
and simple—is a document under seal evidencing
the fact that certain property specified therein
has been absolutely given by the donor to the
donee, without any reservation for the benefit
of the former, or any power for him to revoke
the gift or resume possession of the property
in any circumstances. If the deed contains a
condition that the donor shall have the enjoyment
of the property during his life, and that
he shall have a right to recall the gift thereby
made, and dispose of the property in some other
way, then the document is to all intents and
purposes a will; and if it is only executed and
attested as an ordinary deed, it is altogether void,
in consequence of non-compliance with the directions
contained in the Wills Act, 1837, which
very properly requires more precautions against
fraud and forgery in the case of a will than
in the case of a deed. We say ‘very properly,’
because the will does not take effect during the
lifetime of the testator; and therefore the greatest
safeguard is removed by his death before the document
can be acted upon or its authenticity be
likely to be questioned. This is a common oversight.
The deed is prepared and duly stamped;
and in consequence of the insertion of the powers
alluded to above, it proves to be utterly useless,
when, after the decease of the donor, his property
is claimed by his heir-at-law and next
of kin because of his having died intestate. It
may occasion some surprise that any solicitor
will prepare a deed which he knows cannot
stand the test of litigation; but this is not altogether
the fault of the profession. In many cases,
the danger is pointed out; but if the donor is
determined to dispose of his own property in
his own way, who can gainsay him? If he
cannot get what he requires in one office, he
will go to another; and we have several times
lost clients in consequence of our refusal to
prepare such a deed; all our arguments being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_716">{716}</span>met by the reply that there would be no duties
to pay to the government if the deed were executed;
a complete fallacy in many cases, as we
have afterwards had occasion to know, when
we have seen what followed the decease of the
misguided donor.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if there is a genuine gift,
and possession is given in accordance with the
deed, what then? One case which came under
our notice may illustrate the danger against
which we have frequently protested in vain.
A retired merchant invested the whole of his
savings in a freehold estate which would produce
sufficient annual income to supply all his
wants and leave a good margin for future accumulations.
Being a widower, in somewhat infirm
health, he took up his residence in the house
of his younger son, the elder being an irreclaimable
reprobate. Unfortunately, the wife of
this younger son was an artful and avaricious
woman, whose sole reason for consenting to the
arrangement as to residence was the hope of future
gain. The old gentleman had an insurmountable
objection to making a will—not an uncommon
weakness—as it reminded him too forcibly of
the time when he would have to leave his fine
estate and go over to the great majority. At
length, after urgent and repeated representations
as to the risk of his estate being sold by his
dissipated heir-at-law in case of his dying intestate,
he was persuaded to execute a deed of gift
to his younger son, to whom at the same time
he handed the title-deeds relating to the estate.
Soon afterwards, a quarrel arose between the
donor and his daughter-in-law; and the latter
persuaded her husband—whose moral principles
were as weak as those of his brother, though
in a different way—to sell the estate, and then
turn his father out of his house. After his
ignominious dismissal, the poor old gentleman
went to the house of a nephew, who soon tired
of supporting him; and eventually he was obliged
to go into the workhouse, altogether neglected
to the time of his death by all his relatives,
except his graceless elder son; and alas! he
could not assist his aged parent, as he was
himself almost destitute. This may appear to be
an extreme case; but it is not a solitary one,
although it is one of the worst of those which
have come under our own observation.</p>

<p>This brief narrative may serve as an introduction
to the explanation of one remarkable
peculiarity in the practical working of a deed of
gift of real estate. Personal property may of
course be sold, and the sale completed by delivery
of the goods or other chattels to the purchaser;
but actual possession of land is no clue to the
ownership thereof, the title being evidenced by
deeds in the general way, the exceptions being
those cases in which land has descended to the
heir in consequence of the intestacy of the former
owner; and also those cases in which long-continued
possession has given an impregnable
title to a person who was originally a mere
trespasser, or at the most a tenant whose landlord
has been lost sight of. When the freehold
estate above mentioned was given away and the
gift was evidenced by deed and actual possession,
the donor lost the power of again giving it away
either by deed or by his will. But he might
have sold the property if he could have found
a purchaser willing to complete without actual
possession of the title-deeds; which, however,
he might afterwards have recovered from the
holder thereof; the reason for this being, that
where there are two inconsistent titles, both
derived from the same person, but one depending
upon an actual sale and payment by the purchaser
of the price agreed upon, while the other
rests upon no better foundation than a mere
voluntary act on the part of the donor, the title
of the purchaser will prevail, because of the
valuable consideration which he has paid; while
the other person has paid nothing. On the other
hand, if the donee, before he is dispossessed or
his title superseded by a conveyance for value,
were to sell the property, and if the sale were
completed and the purchase-money paid, the
donor would have lost his right to sell. Having
placed the donee in a position to make a good
title to the property, he must take the consequences
of his own folly. We once had the
pleasure of saving for the benefit of the vendor
the value of an estate which he had previously
given away; greatly to the astonishment of the
donee, who supposed himself to be safely possessed
of the whole estate.</p>

<p>It will be understood that our remarks have
no application to marriage settlements or similar
documents in which extensive though limited
powers of appointment are generally reserved to
the settler, the power extending over the whole
estate or a specified part thereof; while the
persons to be the beneficiaries are strictly defined;
and powers are also given to him to direct the
payment of portions to his younger children, and
to charge them upon the estate which is comprised
in the settlement. This is the legitimate
way in which a landed proprietor can provide for
his family; and the only serious objection which
has ever been made thereto is that it has a
tendency to perpetuate the descent of the estates,
instead of their distribution and subdivision into
smaller properties. But these documents are
beyond the scope of this paper. What we
strongly object to are voluntary deeds of gift,
which are generally made for the purpose of
avoiding the payment of legacy and succession
duty, but lead too frequently to disastrous consequences.
They are beneficial to the legal profession,
often leading to costly and harassing
litigation; but to the intended recipients of the
bounty of the donor, and sometimes to the donor
himself, they are in a corresponding degree
injurious.</p>

<p>Attention may here be called to the provisions
of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1881,
on the subject of voluntary gifts of personal
property made for the purpose of avoiding the
payment of the duties accruing due on the death
of the owner of personal estate. By this Act,
duty is payable at the like rates as the ordinary
probate duty on voluntary gifts which may have
been made by any person dying after 1st June
1881, whether such gift may have been made in
contemplation of approaching death or otherwise,
if the donor has not lived three calendar months
afterwards; or by voluntarily causing property to
be transferred to or vested in himself and some
other person jointly, so as to give such other person
benefit of survivorship; or by deed or other
instrument not taking effect as a will, whereby
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_717">{717}</span>an interest is reserved to the donor for life, or
whereby he may have reserved to himself the
right, by the exercise of any power, to reclaim
the absolute interest in such property. This
enactment removes the last argument in favour
of deeds of gift, for they do not now have the
effect of avoiding the payment of probate duty;
and in any event, since 19th May 1853, succession
duty has always been payable in respect
of the benefit acquired by the successor by reason
of the decease of his predecessor in title. The
case of a voluntary settlement in respect of
which the stamp duty has been paid is provided
for by a direction that on production of
such deed duly stamped, the stamp duty thereon
may be returned. Personal estate includes leasehold
property.</p>

<p>With respect to wills, the position is very different.
Every man who has any property of
any kind ought to make a will, especially if he
desires his property to be distributed in any way
different from the mode prescribed by law in
case of his intestacy. Many cases occur in which
the neglect to make a will is not only foolish
but positively wrong. A husband has a duty
to perform towards his wife which cannot be
omitted without culpability; and the same may
be said of the duty of a parent to his children.
As to the former, there is a danger which is often
unsuspected by the owner of real estate. The
law provides that on the death of such a person
intestate, leaving a widow, she shall be entitled
to dower out of such estate; that is to say, one-third
of the rents thereof during the remainder
of her life; but this right to dower is subject
to any disposition which the owner of the estate
may have made thereof, or any charges which
he may have created thereon. In England,
there is no inalienable share of property which
the widow and children can claim, even as
against the devisee, as is the case in Scotland.
But there is a power to bar the right of the
widow to her dower by means of a declaration
to that effect in the conveyance to a purchaser,
or in any deed subsequently executed
by him relating to the property. It must be
observed that the declaration in bar of dower
is not necessary for the purpose of creating
charges upon the estate, because dower is expressly
made subject to such charges. But if
the declaration has been inserted in the conveyance—without
the knowledge of the purchaser—his
widow will have no claim to any provision
out of such estate unless it shall be made for
her by the will of her husband, who, in ignorance
of the necessity for making a will, dies
intestate, thus leaving his widow dependent upon
his heir-at-law; in numerous cases, a distant
relative, who is not disposed to acknowledge
that the widow of his predecessor has any claim
upon him.</p>

<p>Again, as to his children, the possessor of real
estate ought not to forget that in the case of freehold
property it will descend upon his eldest
son as heir-at-law; thus leaving his younger
sons and his daughters unprovided for except
as to their respective shares of his personal estate,
which may be of small value, or even insufficient
for the payment of his debts. If the property
should be copyhold, it would descend to the
customary heir, who might be the eldest son,
the youngest son, or all the sons as tenants in
common in equal undivided shares; but in any
event, the daughters would remain unprovided
for.</p>

<p class="ph3">AN INCIDENT IN 1801.</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following singular story is perhaps worth
putting on record because the narrative is strictly
true.</p>

<p>In the year 1801, a fine old Jacobean house,
known as Chatford House, situated on the borders
of Devon and Somerset, was in the occupation
of a Mr Edward Leggett, a wealthy farmer, and
his two sons. The house, like many of its class,
had originally been built so that its ground-plan
formed the letter <img class="illowe0_75" src="images/letter_e.jpg" alt="E,">
a centre, with projecting
doorway, and two wings; but one wing had
been taken down altogether, as well as a portion
of the other, so that the ground-plan became
thereby altered and took this form, 
  <img class="illowe0_75" src="images/letter_e_bar_removed.jpg" alt="E with the top bar removed,">
the centre
doorway remaining untouched. This should be
remembered, in order to understand the circumstances
of the principal incident of the narrative.
Over the projecting doorway was a room which
went by the name of the ‘Oratory,’ probably on
account of its large projecting bay window, which
gave it somewhat of an ecclesiastical appearance,
and from this window a view could be obtained
on all sides. The small part of the wing which
was left standing was used as storerooms, and
access from the outside was gained by a small
door, which had been injudiciously opened in
the corner, or angle, when the alterations were
made.</p>

<p>Mr Leggett possessed a large quantity of very
fine old massive silver-plate, which was placed
in one of the storerooms, strongly secured and
locked, in the remains of the wing referred to.
It was supposed that he had also a considerable
sum of money locked up with the plate, as banking
was not so common in remote country-places
in those days.</p>

<p>Now it happened that, on the 23d of April
1801, Mr Leggett and his two sons had to attend
a neighbouring cattle fair, and had proposed to
sleep in the town, instead of returning home the
same night; but, a good customer having arranged
to complete a purchase early the next morning,
Mr Leggett’s eldest son, George, came back to
Chatford very late and went quietly to bed;
but the worry of the fair, and anxiety about
to-morrow’s purchase, prevented him sleeping.
His bedroom was at the end of the house, close
to the store wing, and just above the little door
in the angle already mentioned. Whilst restlessly
tossing about from side to side, young
Leggett heard the house clock strike two, and
just after became aware of a peculiar grating
noise, apparently under his window. To jump
up and cautiously and silently open the casement
was the work of a minute. It was a
cloudy moonlight night, just light enough to
show objects imperfectly, but enough for George
Leggett to observe the figures of two men close
to the little door in the angle immediately below,
on which they were apparently operating with
some cutting tool, which had produced the grating
noise he had heard. George, who was a young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_718">{718}</span>man of great intelligence, quick judgment, and
ready resource, instantly comprehending the situation,
took his measures accordingly. He happened
to be a member of the county yeomanry cavalry;
and catching up his carabine and some ball
cartridges, he silently left his room, and proceeding
down the corridor—loading his carabine
as he went along—soon reached the ‘Oratory’
room over the porch, whence he could see straight
down on to the little door, which was then right
in front of him. Silently opening the casement,
he made a careful survey of the position, which
a passing ray of moonlight enabled him to take
in at a glance.</p>

<p>At the little white-painted door were the two
men, whose dark figures were well thrown
up by so light a background. One was stooping
or kneeling, and the other was standing
close behind him, their backs, of course, being
turned towards their observer. Putting his carabine
on full-cock and laying it carefully on the
window-sill, after a deliberate aim, Leggett pressed
the trigger. A loud shriek and a stifled cry
followed, then all was still. Leggett stood intently
watching the spot for several moments;
but profound silence prevailed—not a sound was
heard, not a movement was perceptible. The
only other man in the house was the groom,
who was quickly roused; and lanterns having
been procured, he and Leggett repaired to the
spot, and were not a little staggered to find both
burglars lying dead. The hand of one of them
still grasped a very large steel centre-bit, with
which he had been operating on the door. Subsequent
surgical investigation showed that the
bullet had struck the back of the first man,
passing through his heart, and had then entered
the head of the man who was stooping or kneeling
in front of him, just behind the ear, lodging in
the brain. The bodies were at once removed
in-doors; and at the inquest, held the next day,
the following particulars were elicited:</p>

<p>By the side of the dead men was found a
leather travelling portmanteau, containing a
highly finished and elaborate set of housebreaking
tools, together with a piece of candle
and a preparation of phosphorus for obtaining
a light, as it is needless to say that lucifer
matches were unknown in 1801, their place being
supplied by the old-fashioned flint and steel and
tinder-box, articles not available for burglars’ use.
Each man was armed with a brace of pocket
pistols, loaded and primed; and one of them
carried a formidable-looking dagger, fitted into
the breast of his coat; clearly showing that these
ruffians were prepared to offer a desperate resistance,
if interrupted or molested. They were
both well dressed, and had quite the appearance
of gentlemen. Each possessed a good watch and
seals, and carried a well-filled purse. One only
had a pocket-book, containing many papers, chiefly
relating to money matters and betting transactions;
but only one letter, which, however, proved
of immense importance in throwing light on the
lives and characters of the deceased burglars,
and in telling the story of the attempted robbery.
The letter was directed to ‘Mr John Bellamy,’
at an address in Shoreditch, London, and was
dated from Roxburn, the name of a large neighbouring
farm, and bore the initials ‘J. P.,’ which,
with the writing, were at once recognised at the
inquest as those of ‘James Palmer,’ the managing
bailiff at Roxburn Farm, a clever and unscrupulous
fellow, without any regard for truth or
principle, well known in those parts, but a man
whom nobody liked and everybody distrusted.
This communication was in these few but significant
words: ‘The 23d will do best; coast clear,
no fear, all straight.—J. P.’</p>

<p>This letter, with the tools and a full report
of the whole case, was at once sent to Bow Street,
London, and an investigation made by the ‘Bow
Street runners’—the detectives of those days—for
there were then no regular ‘police,’ as we
now understand the term. On searching the
premises in Shoreditch, indicated in the letter,
where John Bellamy lived, it was discovered
that the supposed John Bellamy was no other
than ‘Jack Rolfe,’ one of the most successful professional
burglars of that day; and the authorities
hesitated not to express their satisfaction that his
career had been so cleverly cut short.</p>

<p>An immense quantity of stolen property, of
almost every description, was found at Rolfe’s
lodgings in Shoreditch; and what was more
important—as regards the present narrative at
least—a correspondence extending over three
or four years between Mr James Palmer of
Roxburn Farm and the arch-burglar John
Bellamy, alias Jack Rolfe himself, by which it
appeared that this robbery had been planned
and arranged by Palmer, who had supplied Rolfe
with the fullest information as to Mr Leggett’s
plate and money, as well as a neatly drawn plan
of the premises, which was found amongst the
papers. Palmer had also arranged the date of
the robbery for the 23d of April, as he had
discovered that Mr Leggett and his two sons
intended to sleep out that night. Nor was this
all; for only a few weeks previously, the rascal
had had the effrontery to invite Rolfe to pay
him a visit at Roxburn, under colour of his
being a personal friend, which invitation Rolfe
had readily accepted; and one of the witnesses
at the inquest well remembered his coming, and
at once recognised him in one of the dead men—he
of the centre-bit. Rolfe was described
as a quiet, pleasant, and rather gentlemanly
man.</p>

<p>Not far from Mr Leggett’s gate, a light cart
and pony were found tethered early in the
morning of the attempted robbery. The cart had
been hired from a neighbouring market-town to
convey the thieves to the scene of operations,
and to bring them back with—as they fondly
anticipated—a sackful of rich plunder. They
had been staying a day or two at this inn as
commercial travellers, calling themselves brothers,
and giving the name of Sutton.</p>

<p>On the evidence afforded by the correspondence
found in Shoreditch, Palmer was apprehended;
and further investigation brought out the fact
that the notorious Jack Rolfe was not only his
friend, correspondent, and accomplice, but his
own brother also, Rolfe being merely an ‘alias’
for his real name of Palmer. The two men were
very much alike both in face and figure; and
it came out in evidence that they belonged to
a family of burglars and sharpers. One brother
had been transported for life for robbery and
violence; another was then in prison for fraud
and theft; James had just been apprehended;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_719">{719}</span>and John had been shot dead whilst plying his
trade. James appeared to have been the only
member who had held a respectable position—that
of manager of Roxburn Farm, and he could
not keep away from dishonest practices. It was
also further discovered that Palmer had been an
accomplice in two or three mysterious burglaries
which had been perpetrated in the neighbourhood
during the two or three previous years, in
which the thieves had displayed an accurate
knowledge—even to minute details—of the premises
attacked, the habits of the inmates, and
the drawers or closets where valuables were
kept. All this was due to the planning and
arranging of the brother James, who could at his
leisure quietly take his measures on the spot;
which were then carefully communicated to his
brother John, who ultimately became the willing
executant. Palmer was shortly after brought to
trial, convicted, and sentenced to fourteen years’
transportation.</p>

<p>The verdict of the coroner’s jury was ‘justifiable
homicide;’ for in those days of desperate and
well-armed burglars, the shooting of one or two
of these gentry, whilst in the act of plying their
nefarious calling, was considered not only a clever
but a meritorious action.</p>




<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop"><div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_EVIDENCE_OF_THE_SENSES">THE EVIDENCE OF THE SENSES.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> senses are the witnesses which bring in
evidence from the outer world, without which
that world would for us have no existence at all;
but the mind sits aloft on the judgment-seat
and forms its conclusions from the evidence laid
before it; and these conclusions are for the
most part wonderfully correct; for, though the
testimony of one sense alone might lead the
mind to form an erroneous opinion, this can
be rectified by discovering what one or more
of the other senses have to say on the same
subject. When, however—as sometimes happens
under peculiar circumstances—the evidence of
one sense only is available, the mind may very
readily arrive at a false conclusion. As an
instance of this may be cited what is often observed
by surgeons in cases of hip-joint disease.
The patient, usually a child, complains of severe
pain in the knee, which, however, has not, so
far as can be ascertained, been injured in any
way. Very likely, the pain is severe enough
to prevent sleep at night, so that there can be
no doubt about its existence, and it may perhaps
have been almost continuous for some time past.
Now, in such a case the surgeon will have a
shrewd suspicion of what is really amiss, and
very often will at once proceed to examine the
hip. This he will do, too, in spite of assurances
on the part of the parents that the patient always
complains of the knee and of that joint only.
He does not doubt that the pain feels as if it
was in the knee, but he strongly suspects, nevertheless,
that the disease is in the hip; and this
often proves to be the case. This is an instance
of what is called ‘referred sensation.’ The nerve
which conveys sensation from the knee also sends
a branch to the hip-joint, and it is this anatomical
fact which explains the phenomenon. It
might be expected that even if the pain was
not felt solely in the hip, it would at least be
always felt there as well as in the knee. This,
however, though sometimes the case, is by no
means always so. In this instance, the patient
comes not unnaturally to the conclusion that
where he feels the pain, there the cause of the
pain must of necessity be situated. He would
be quite ready to declare that there was nothing
the matter with his hip, for he cannot see into
the joint and discover the disease there. He has,
in fact, to depend upon the evidence of one sense
only, and the conclusion based upon the evidence
of the single sensation of pain, is false.</p>

<p>Another instance in which the testimony of
one sense alone may lead to a false conclusion
as to the whereabouts of the cause of a pain is
found in what often takes place after the amputation
of a limb. Most people are aware that
after part of a limb has been removed by the
surgeon’s knife, the patient may still feel as
though his arm or leg, as the case may be, was
entire, may feel much pain in the foot when the
leg has been amputated far above the ankle.
Here, in recovering from the effects of the anæsthetic,
were it not for the additional evidence
of his eyesight, the patient might well doubt
whether his limb had been removed at all. The
amusing story, in Marryat’s <i>Jacob Faithful</i>, of the
old sailor who, having two wooden legs, was
accustomed at times to wrap them up in flannel
on account of the rheumatic pains which he said
he felt in them, is not so very extravagant after
all. It is not, however, altogether correct, as
it represents the man feeling these pains in his
legs <i>long</i> after they had been amputated. As a
matter of fact, the false impression passes off
before very long. The explanation given by
physiologists is as follows: The severed nerve
in the stump is irritated and gives rise to pain;
and inasmuch as irritation to this nerve-trunk
has hitherto been always caused by irritation of
its ultimate filaments distributed to the foot and
leg, the mind continues for some time to believe
that the sensation still proceeds from thence.</p>

<p>We may glance at another and very similar
instance of referred sensations occurring also in
surgical practice. Amongst the rarer operations
of what is termed plastic, and, by Sir James
Paget, ‘decorative’ surgery is that by which a
new nose is formed by calling in the aid of the
tissue of other parts of the body. This has
been done by bringing a flap of skin cut from
the forehead down over the nasal bones. The
flap retains its connection with the deeper
tissues at a point between the eyes by means
of a small pedicle, and thus its blood-vessels
and nerves are not all severed. This flap is
not simply pulled down from the forehead—it
is twisted at the pedicle, so that the raw surface
lies on the bones of the nose. Now, for
some time after this operation has been performed,
any irritation in the nose is referred by the
mind to that part of the forehead from which the
flap of skin was taken; and therefore, if a fly
crawls over the patient’s nose, it appears to him
to be creeping across his forehead. Before the
operation, whenever the nerve-ends in the flap
were irritated, it was caused by something touching
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_720">{720}</span>the forehead, and it is some time before the mind
ceases to refer such irritation to that part of
the face.</p>

<p>Leaving, now, the domain of surgery, we may
notice two simple experiments mentioned by
physiologists, which all can perform for themselves.
They both prove that conclusions formed
upon the evidence of the sense of touch alone
may be quite incorrect. By crossing the
second finger over the first, and then placing
a marble between the tips of the fingers, we
get a sensation that leads us to suppose that
there must be two marbles instead of one only.
This is because two points in the fingers are
touched simultaneously, which in the ordinary
position could only be touched at the same
moment by two marbles. Judging, then, from
the sense of touch alone, the mind infers that
there are two round hard substances beneath
the finger-tips; but the evidence of eyesight and
the knowledge that we have placed but one
marble in position, corrects the misapprehension.
Again, if we take a pair of compasses the points
of which are not sufficiently sharp to prick the
skin, and separating the extremities rather more
than an inch from one another, draw them
across the cheek transversely from a little in
front of one ear to the lips, we shall be tempted
to think, from the evidence of touch alone, that
the points are becoming more widely separated.
By measuring the distance between the two points
afterwards, we can assure ourselves that this has
not been so; but whilst the compasses were being
drawn along the cheek, and still more when they
had reached the lips, the impression that the
distance between the points increased was very
strong. This delusion is said to depend upon
the fact, that some parts of the cutaneous covering
of the body are much more plentifully
supplied with nerves than others. It is stated
that the mind probably forms its idea of the
distance between two points on the skin which
are irritated in any way—as, for instance, by
the points of a pair of compasses touching the
surface—by the number of nerve-endings lying
between these two points which remain unirritated.
Thus, if there be fewer unirritated nerve-endings
lying between the two points of the
compasses when placed on the cheek, than there
are when they are placed at the lips, the mind
will infer that the distance between these points
is smaller in the former position than in the
latter.</p>




<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop"><div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak smalltext" id="THE_STATES_NEGLECT_OF_DENTISTRY">THE STATE’S NEGLECT OF DENTISTRY.</h2></div>


<p>The machinery of the State is so vast that it
may well be imperfect here and there. It frequently
falls to the lot of individuals to point
out how the tide of progress has left details in
a condition of inefficiency. We note a recent
instance of this. In August last, at the annual
meeting of the British Dental Association, Mr
George Cunningham, one of its members, drew
attention to the backwardness of the practice of
dentistry in the various departments of the
State. The substance of his case amounted to
this: In the army and navy, unskilled practitioners
wielded uncouth and inefficient instruments
in following antiquated and unscientific
methods; while the police force and the employees
of the India and Post offices by no means
derived the full advantages of this department
of medical science. Mr Cunningham was bold
enough to include the inmates of prisons among
those whose interests were neglected; and of
course the principle of the humane treatment
of criminals is already conceded in the appointment
of jail chaplains and surgeons. We need
not enter here into the voluminous details with
which Mr Cunningham substantiated his case.
The broad conclusions he would seem to draw
are these: that the medical practitioner employed
by the State should possess a more
thorough knowledge of dentistry; that, where
necessary, the services of the completely trained
and qualified dentist should be secured; and that
full resort should be had to the remedial resources
of dental science. Seeing the suffering
caused by diseases of the teeth, and the subtle
and intimate connection existing between dental
and other maladies, we trust Mr Cunningham’s
paper may receive the consideration it would
seem to deserve.</p>

<p>Persons wishing to keep up their information
on subjects connected with trade and changes in
foreign tariffs may do so by consulting the <i>Board
of Trade Journal</i>, the first numbers of which have
just been issued. An attempt is also made in

to trade movements abroad, from the communications
of the different consuls and colonial

deserves the support of all merchants and manufacturers
at all interested in our foreign trade.
Formerly, the commercial Reports from Her
